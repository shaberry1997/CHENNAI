    <p>Recorded presence of Muslims in Chennai dates from the 9th century CE onwards. The oldest known mosques in Madras – the ones at Pulicat and Kovalam – were built in the 10th century CE. Both Marco Polo in the 13th century and Duarte Barbarosa in the 16th century record that St. Thomas was venerated by Christians as well as Muslims of Madras. Muslims living in the city have varied cultural and historical origins and are currently the second largest religious community of Chennai,[5] accounting for around 9.4 percent of the population according to the 2001 census.</p>
