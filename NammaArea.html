  <p>Recorded presence of Muslims in Chennai dates from the 9th century CE onwards. The oldest known mosques in Madras – the ones at Pulicat and Kovalam – were built in the 10th century CE. Both Marco Polo in the 13th century and Duarte Barbarosa in the 16th century record that St. Thomas was venerated by Christians as well as Muslims of Madras. Muslims living in the city have varied cultural and historical origins and are currently the second largest religious community of Chennai,[5] accounting for around 9.4 percent of the population according to the 2001 census.</p>

    <p>Street food, as in other areas of India, are popular in Chennai,[1] despite the common belief in India that street food is unhealthy.[2] The idly sambhar is a popular dish, which is served as breakfast or dinner. Apart from regular South Indian street food, the city's streets are also filled with several North Indian street food outlets, most of them established by North Indian migrants themselves.[3] Gujarati[3] and Burmese[4] are also available. Street food in Chennai is so popular that a game had developed based on the TV show The Amazing Race where contestants have to follow clues to street-food spots in the city.</p>
